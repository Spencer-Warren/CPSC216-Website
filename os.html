            <p class="os_p">Windows is a series of operating systems (OS), developed by Microsoft for personal computers. 
            Each OS comes with a graphical interface (GUI) that allows users to view, interact and change files, videos and documents.
            Windows is made for all standard x86 hardware and comes with most PCs or laptops.
            The most current Windows version is Windows 10 which currently is 75% of the market according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/993868/worldwide-windows-operating-system-market-share/#:~:text=Windows%2010%20is%20the%20most,share%20as%20of%20September%202020">statista</a></p>
            <img class="os_img" id="float_right" src="images/OS/linux.png" alt="linux" title="linux">
            <p class="os_p" style="clear:left;">Linux is an open source operating system based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">UNIX.</a>
            Users can modify the source code and create their own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions">distributions.</a>
            Linux also comes with a graphical interface (GUI) with some necessary daily use software.
            It's used in desktops, mobile devices, gaming consoles, digital storage devices, eReaders, cameras and video recorders.
            However, Linux is mostly used for servers, as most of the web pages on the internet are from Linux servers.
            You can easily spin up a linux server using services like amazon's <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/?ec2-whats-new.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&ec2-whats-new.sort-order=desc">EC2 Instances</a>
